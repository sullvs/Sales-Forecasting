# Sales-Forecasting
This project aims to enhance sales forecasting by leveraging AI techniques to provide a comprehensive perspective. Traditional forecasting methods often focus on a single type of analysis, but our approach incorporates predictive analysis using machine learning, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost models. Trained on the BigMart open-source dataset, the models predict future sales trends to help businesses allocate resources, manage cash flow, and respond to demand. Results show that XGBoost, with an R-squared of 0.7456 (using grid search), outperformed Random Forest, which achieved an R-squared of 0.7426 (with grid search and feature selection).
